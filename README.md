# My personal webapage ðŸ’¥ðŸš€

Personal page that I use to make myself known to the world. Developed in Vue with TypeScript and Tailwind. The hosting is done thanks to Firebase.

## Run it ðŸ’»

Clone the repo and run `npm i` in the root folder of the project to install the necesary dependencies. Then, to run the project type:

```
npm run serve
```

You can now open the page following the shell instructions, the web will be reloaded with every change that you make.

The project will be auto-updated/auto-deployed when a new push come to the main branch of this repo.

## Recommedations ðŸ‘€

In order to have a correct code formatting it is recommended to have the Prettier extension installed in your text editor.

Other extensions such as Vetur or Tailwind CSS IntelliSense have also been useful for the development of the project.
