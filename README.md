Personal page that I use to make myself known to the world. Developed in pure HTML + JS + CSS. The hosting is done thanks to Firebase.

Clone the repo. After, you will need to install the firebase CLI running:

```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

Finally, type `firebase serve` to compile your app. Code changes will be submited automatically when you refresh the server (localhost).
